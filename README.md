# hasktris
Hasktris is a text-based TicTacToe game.
To start a game use the function 'startGame' with the
choosen algorithm (e.g. "startGame alphabeta").
There are two implemented algorithms: 'negamax', which does
not do any pruning, and 'alphabeta', which does alpha-beta
pruning. Of course pruning is not needed for such as simple game,
the purpose of the application is to test possible implementations
of the negamax algorithm in Haskell.
